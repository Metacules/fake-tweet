## Usage

To use the `fake-tweet` component in your app after having installed it, import the component and its stylesheet:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import FakeTweet from 'fake-tweet';
import 'fake-tweet/build/index.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <FakeTweet config={
          {
            user: {
              nickname: "twitter",
              name: "Twitter",
              avatar: "avatar.png",
              verified: true,
              locked: false
            },
            nightMode: false,
            text: "This is a fake tweet",
            image: "",
            date: "3:32 PM Â· Feb 14, 1997",
            app: "Twitter for iPhone",
            retweets: 32000,
            likes: 12700
          }
        }/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

* User:
    * Nickname: Twitter @username
    * Name
    * Avatar: Twitter avatar URL

* Text: The text the tweet will display
* Image (optional): You can include an image to the tweet
* Date: A string that represents a date
